Title: SpaceBalls: Return of The PerScholas
Description: User will be able view data about the first six Star Wars films, including Characters, Planets, and much much more! By shifting to a galexy far, far away, user can learn information about vehicles and starships featured in the films as well as details about their favorite characters. This application allows anyone from a new fan watching for the first time to a die hard Star Wars fan to have fun viewing all the trivia and details about the movies and characters of Star Wars.
Wireframes:
Compnents Hiearachy: 
API: We used The Star Wars API (SWAPI)
    Root URL: https://swapi.dev/api/
    Documentation: https://swapi.dev/documentation
MVP: Our initial goal for the application was to be able to use the Browser Router to link different pages using a navigation bar. By clicking on each link, the page would change and depending on which link was clicked, the URL would change and call the API depending on the category that was clicked. When the page renders, the code would map over and array of information from the API and display a variety of information for each object in the array.
Post_MVP: It would be nice to find an api library that had pictures so that each card could have a picture in the mapped information or would would have liked to created a library with pictures that would could have implemented.
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
