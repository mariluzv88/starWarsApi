###Title:SpaceBalls: Return of The PerScholas
###Description: User will be able to view data about the first six Star Wars films, including Characters, Planets, and much much more! By shifting to a galaxy far, far away, user can learn information about vehicles and starships featured in the films as well as details about their favorite characters. This application allows anyone from a new fan watching for the first time to a die-hard Star Wars fan to have fun viewing all the trivia and details about the movies and characters of Star Wars.
###Wireframes:
###Components Hierarchy: 
###API:
*We used The Star Wars API (SWAPI)
*Root URL: https://swapi.dev/api/
* Documentation: https://swapi.dev/documentation
###MVP: Our initial goal for the application was to be able to use the Browser Router to link different pages using a navigation bar. By clicking on each link, the page would change, and depending on which link was clicked, the URL would change and call the API depending on the category that was clicked. When the page renders, the code would map over an array of information from the API and display a variety of information for each object in the array.
###Post_MVP: It would be nice to find an API library that had pictures so that each card could have a picture in the mapped information or would have liked to create a library with pictures that would have implemented.
